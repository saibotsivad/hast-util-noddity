# hast-util-noddity

[Micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) and [hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) extension to parse [noddity](http://noddity.com/) syntax from within HTML.

**Note:** if you're looking for a more complete library, have a look at [noddity-micromark-renderer](https://github.com/saibotsivad/noddity-micromark-renderer). This package does not resolve Noddity links or anything like that, it just parses text in the HTML to a tree.
